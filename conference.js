The medical field is no exception; medical professionals rely upon technology to provide them with accurate information and base life-changing decisions on this data. <br />In recent years there has been more attention paid to the security of medical devices; however, there has been little research done on the unique protocols used by these devices. In large, health care systems medical personnel take advantage of to make decisions on patient treatment and other critical care, use central monitoring stations. This information is gathered from many devices on the network using uncommon networking protocols. What if this information wasn&apos;t accurate when a doctor prescribed medication? What if a patient was thought to be peacefully resting, when in fact they are under cardiac arrest? <br />McAfee&apos;s Advanced Threat Research team has discovered a weakness in the RWHAT protocol, one of the networking protocols used by medical devices to monitor a patient&apos;s condition. This protocol is utilized in some of the most critical systems used in hospitals. This weakness allows the data to be modified by an attacker in real-time to provide false information to medical personnel. Lack of authentication also allows rogue devices to be placed onto the network and mimic patient monitors. <br />This presentation will include a technical dissection of the security issues inherent in this relatively unknown protocol. It will describe real-world attack scenarios and demonstrate the ability to modify the communications in-transit to directly influence the receiving devices. We will also explore the general lack of security mitigations in the medical devices field, the risks they pose, and techniques to address them.

Unfortunately, there have been few research efforts focusing on scalablility in analyzing very large PCAP file with reasonable computing resources. Asura is a portable and scalable PCAP file analyzer for detecting anomaly packets using massive multithreading. Asura&apos;s parallel packet dump inspection is based on task-based decomposition and therefore can handle massive threads for large PCAP file without considering tidy parameter selection in adopting data decomposition. Asura is designed to scale out in processing large PCAP file by taking as many threads as possible. <br />Asura takes two steps. First, Asura extracts feature vector represented by associative containers of &lt;sourceIP, destIP&gt; pair. By doing this, the feature vector can be drastically small compared with the size of original PCAP files. In other words, Asura can reduce packet dump data into the size of unique &lt;sourceIP, destIP&gt; pairs (for example, in experiment, Asura&apos;s output which is reduced in first step is about 2% compared with the size of original libpcap files). Second, a parallel clustering algorithm is applied for the feature vector which is represented as {&lt;sourceIP, destIP&gt;, V[i]} where V[i] is aggregated flow vector. In second step, Asura adopts an enhanced Kmeans algorithm. Concretely, two functions of Kmeans which are (1)calculating distance and (2)relabeling points are improved for parallel processing. <br />In experiment, in processing public PCAP datasets, Asura can identified 750 packets which are labeled as malicious from among 70 million (about 18GB) normal packets. In a nutshell, Asura successfully found 750 malicious packets in about 18GB packet dump. For Asura to inspect 70 million packets, it took reasonable computing time of around 350-450 minutes with 1000-5000 multithreading by running commodity workstation. Asura will be released under MIT license and available at author&apos;s GitHub site on the first day of DEF CON 26.\"},\"attacking-the-macos-kernel-graphics-driver\":{\"speakers\":[\"wang-yu\"],\"title\":\"Attacking the macOS Kernel Graphics Driver\",\"fullDate\":\"Sun 12 Aug 2018 12:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.12\",\"day\":\"Sunday\",\"start\":\"12:00\",\"duration\":45,\"location\":\"Track 2\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\",\"Exploit\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Sunday at 12:00 in Track 2 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit\",\"abstract\":\"Just like the Windows platform, graphic drivers of macOS kernel are complicated and provide a large promising attack surface for EoPs and sandbox escapes from low-privileged processes.

While much research and automated detection technology has so far focused on the discovery of vulnerable entry points (i.e. code that deserializes untrusted data), finding a &quot;gadget chain&quot; to actually make the vulnerability exploitable has thus far been a largely manual exercise.

Whilst more advanced techniques, such as correlating malicious activity with timezones, or linking attacks through the use of similar techniques or malware, can be useful, they tend to take investigators further away from the individuals responsible; at best, some inference about the country or specific actor group/collective can be made. <br />In this talk, I present a method for linking incidents to individual attackers with a high degree of accuracy, based on extremely fine-grained behavioural characteristics. This involves an investigatory technique known as &quot;case linkage analysis&quot; (CLA), which uses granular aspects of crime scene behaviours to link common offenders together through statistical comparison. It&apos;s been applied to some crime types before, but never to cyber attacks. <br />I&apos;ll cover how CLA works, its advantages and disadvantages, and how it has previously been applied to a range of crimes, from burglary to homicide. I&apos;ll place it within the context of personality psychology, biometrics, forensic criminology, offender profiling, and forensic linguistics; and will walk through applying it practically. <br />I&apos;ll then show the results of a novel experiment I conducted applying CLA to network intrusion attacks, which involved logging the keystrokes of volunteer attackers across different simulated intrusions, breaking these down into specific behaviours and syntax, and using these to link individuals to their offences. The end result: the way you type commands, including your choice and order of syntax, switches, and options, can form distinctive behavioural signatures, which can be used to link attackers together. Linking accuracy rates as high as 99% were achieved. <br />Finally, I&apos;ll talk about the implications for both defenders and everyone else (particularly focusing on the privacy implications), explore ways in which these techniques could be defeated, and outline some ideas for future research in these areas.\"},\"beyond-the-lulz-black-hat-trolling-white-hat-trolling-attacking-and-defending-our-attention-landscape\":{\"speakers\":[\"goerzen-matt\",\"matthews-dr-jeanna\",\"donovan-joan\"],\"title\":\"Beyond the Lulz: Black-Hat Trolling, White-Hat Trolling, Attacking and Defending Our Attention Landscape\",\"fullDate\":\"Sat 11 Aug 2018 08:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.11\",\"day\":\"Saturday\",\"start\":\"20:00\",\"duration\":0,\"location\":\"Octavius 9 Fireside Hax\",\"tags\":[],\"rawDetails\":\"Saturday at 20:00 in Octavius 9 Fireside Hax |\",\"abstract\":\"White hat or critical grey hat trolling?

First we will introduce some internals and details about the OS and then we will show the techniques used to reverse engineering the mipsN32 ABI code for the Cavium Octeon processor. It will be discussed how some code was emulated to detect how a dynamic password is generated with a cryptographic algorithm for a root shell backdoor. Besides, it will be shown how some protocols used by some services were reverse engineered to find unauthenticated heap and stack overflow vulnerabilities that could be exploitable trough Wireless or Ethernet connection. <br />This OS also uses a proprietary layer 2/3 protocol called MiNT. This protocol is used for communication between WingOS devices through VLAN or IP. This protocol was also reverse engineered and remote heap/stack overflow vulnerabilities were found on services using this protocol and will be shown. As a live demonstration, 2 devices will be used to exploit a remote stack overflow chaining several vulnerabilities as the attacker could do inside an aircraft (or other scenarios) through the Wi-Fi.

Therefore, many 0days have been discovered via this approach in popular web frameworks written in trending programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript. <br />Being a very fundamental problem that exists in path normalization logic, sophisticated web frameworks can also suffer. For example, we&apos;ve found various 0days on Java Spring Framework, Ruby on Rails, Next.js, and Python aiohttp, just to name a few.

To make things worse, we&apos;re able to chain path normalization bugs to bypass authentication and achieve RCE in real world Bug Bounty Programs. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how path normalization can be exploited to achieve sensitive information disclosure, SMB-Relay and RCE. <br />Understanding the basics of this technique, the audience won&apos;t be surprised to know that more than 10 vulnerabilities have been found in sophisticated frameworks and multi-layered web architectures aforementioned via this technique.\"},\"breaking-smart-speakers-we-are-listening-to-you\":{\"speakers\":[\"huiyu-wu\",\"wenxiang-qian\"],\"title\":\"Breaking Smart Speakers: We are Listening to You.\",\"fullDate\":\"Sun 12 Aug 2018 12:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.12\",\"day\":\"Sunday\",\"start\":\"12:00\",\"duration\":45,\"location\":\"101 Track, Flamingo\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\",\"Exploit\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Sunday at 12:00 in 101 Track, Flamingo 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit\",\"abstract\":\"In the past two years, smart speakers have become the most popular IoT device, Amazon_ Google and Apple have introduced their own smart speaker products.

After a successful trial on macOS, Apple applied sandbox mechanism to iOS 6. In its implementation, the policy hooked dozens of operations. The number of hooks has been growing steadily when new system calls or newly discovered threats appeared. In the beginning, Apple&apos;s sandbox used a black list approach which means Apple originally concentrated on the known dangerous APIs and blocked them, allowing all others by default. However, with the evolution of Apple&apos;s sandbox, it applies a white list approach that denies all APIs and only allows secure ones that Apple trusts. <br />In this talk, we will first introduce Apple&apos;s sandbox mechanism and profiles in the latest iOS. Then, we discuss iOS IPC mechanism and review several old classic sandbox escape bugs. Most importantly, we show two new zero-day sandbox escape vulnerabilities we recently discovered in the latest iOS 11.4.

Mobile Point of Sales (mPOS) terminals have propelled this growth lowering the barriers for small and micro-sized businesses to accept non-cash payments. Older payment technologies like mag-stripe still account for the largest majority of all in-person transactions. This is complicated further by the introduction of new payment standards such as NFC. As with each new iteration in payment technology, inevitably weaknesses are introduced into this increasingly complex payment eco-system. <br />In this talk, we ask, what are the security and fraud implications of removing the economic barriers to accepting card payments; and what are the risks associated with continued reliance on old card standards like mag-stripe? In the past, testing for payment attack vectors has been limited to the scope of individual projects and to those that have permanent access to POS and payment infrastructure. Not anymore! <br />In what we believe to be the most comprehensive research conducted in this area, we consider four of the major mPOS providers spread across the US and Europe; Square, SumUp, iZettle and Paypal.

Using this sampled geographic approach, we are able to show the current attack surface of mPOS and, to predict how this will evolve over the coming years. <br />For audience members that are interested in integrating testing practices into their organization or research practices, we will show you how to use mPOS to identify weaknesses in payment technologies, and how to remain undetected in spite of anti-fraud and security mechanisms.\"},\"fuzzing-malware-for-fun--profit-applying-coverage-guided-fuzzing-to-find-and-exploit-bugs-in-modern-malware\":{\"speakers\":[\"shudrak-maksim\"],\"title\":\"Fuzzing Malware For Fun &amp; Profit.

In addition, vendor implementations have not been thoroughly tested for security by independent third parties, due to protocol complexity and the lack of proper (hardware/software) tools. We strongly believe in Wright&apos;s principle,&quot;Security does not improve until practical tools for exploration of the attack surface are made available.&quot;\"},\"its-assembler-jim-but-not-as-we-know-it-abusing-binaries-from-embedded-devices-for-fun-and-profit\":{\"speakers\":[\"gangwere-morgan-indroraaposapos\"],\"title\":\"It&apos;s Assembler, Jim, but not as we know it: (ab)using binaries from embedded devices for fun and profit\",\"fullDate\":\"Fri 10 Aug 2018 12:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.10\",\"day\":\"Friday\",\"start\":\"12:00\",\"duration\":45,\"location\":\"101 Track, Flamingo\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Friday at 12:00 in 101 Track, Flamingo 45 minutes | Demo\",\"abstract\":\"With the proliferation of Linux-based SoCs -- you&apos;ve likely got one or two in your house, on your person or in your pocket -- it is often useful to look &quot;under the hood&quot; at what is running; Additionally, in-situ debugging may be unavailable due to read-only filesystems, memory is often limited, and other factors keep us from attacking a live device.

However, while the communication over Internet is routinely secured, there is still an area where such security awareness is not seen: inside individual computers, where adversaries are often not expected. <br />This talk discusses the security of various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms that local processes and applications use to interact with each other. In particular, we show IPC-related vulnerabilities that allow a non-privileged process to steal passwords stored in popular password managers and even second factors from hardware tokens. With passwords being the primary way of authentication, the insecurity of this &quot;last mile&quot; causes the security of the rest of the communication strands to be obsolete. The vulnerabilities that we demonstrate can be exploited on multi-user computers that may have processes of multiple users running at the same time. The attacker is a non-privileged user trying to steal sensitive information from other users. Such computers can be found in enterprises with centralized access control that gives multiple users access to the same host. Computers with guest accounts and shared computers at home are similarly vulnerable.\"},\"looking-for-the-perfect-signature-an-automatic-yara-rules-generation-algorithm-in-the-ai-era\":{\"speakers\":[\"marcelli-andrea\"],\"title\":\"Looking for the perfect signature: an automatic YARA rules generation algorithm in the AI-era\",\"fullDate\":\"Sat 11 Aug 2018 01:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.11\",\"day\":\"Saturday\",\"start\":\"13:00\",\"duration\":20,\"location\":\"Track 3\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\",\"Tool\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Saturday at 13:00 in Track 3 20 minutes | Demo, Tool\",\"abstract\":\"Given the high pace at which new malware variants are generated, antivirus programs struggle to keep their signatures up-to-date, and AV scanners suffer from a considerable quantity of false negatives.

However, luckily for game vendors, commercial Android emulators usually use an x86/ARM mixed-mode emulation for speed-up.

Not every technologist is comfortable with launching and managing a nonprofit organization let alone has all of the technical knowhow to run an ISP. We didn&apos;t either when we started. We had a goal, and that was to route unfiltered Tor exit traffic in the Seattle Internet Exchange despite National Security Agency (NSA) wiretaps in the Westin Exchange Building.

They assume PE files come as-is, but the Windows Loader actually applies many mutations (some at the command of the PE itself) before execution ever begins. This talk is about bending that loader to one&apos;s whim with the Relocations Table as a command spell. It will demonstrate how the loader can be instrumented into a mutation engine capable of transforming an utterly mangled PE file into a valid executable. This method starts with multiple ASLR Preselection attacks that force binary mapping at a predictable address. It then mangles the PE file, garbling any byte not required prior to relocation. Finally, it embeds a new Relocations Table which, when paired with a preselected base address, causes the loader to reconstruct the PE and execute it with ease. This isn&apos;t a packer or a POC, it is a PE rebuilder which generates completely valid, stable, and vastly tool-breaking executables.

Responses to the presentation have often been emotional and have corroborated his thesis. The real impact of this work on people over the long term has to be mitigated by counter-measures and strategies so scars can be endured or,even better,incorporated and put to use.<br /> In this presentation, Thieme elaborates those strategies and counter-measures. In what is likely his final speech at Def Con, he speaks directly to the &#x201C;human in the machine&#x201D; AS a human being. It&#x2019;s not about leaving the profession: it&#x2019;s about what we can do to thrive and transcend the challenges. It&#x2018;s about &#x201C;saving this space,&#x201D; this play space of hacking, work and life, and knowing the cost of being fully human while encountering dehumanizing impacts.<br /> It is easier to focus on exploits, cool tools, zero days, and the games we play in the space that &#x201C;makes us smile.&#x201D; It is not so easy to know how to play through the pain successfully. The damage to us does not show up in brain scans. It shows up in our families, our relationships, and our lives.<br /> Thieme is not preaching, he is sharing insights based on what he too has had to transcend in his own life.

TRITON is the most complex publicly known ICS attack framework to date and the first publicly known one to target safety controllers. While the functionality of the malware is understood, little is known about the complexity of developing such an implant. The goal of this talk is to provide the audience with a &#x201C;through the eyes of the attacker&#x201D; experience in designing advanced embedded systems exploits &amp; implants for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Attendees will learn about the background of the TRITON incident, the process of reverse-engineering and exploiting ICS devices and developing implants and OT payloads as part of a cyber-physical attack and will be provided with details on real-world ICS vulnerabilities and implant strategies.<br /> In the first part of the talk we will provide an introduction to ICS attacks in general and the TRITON incident in particular. We will outline the danger of TRITON being repurposed by copycats and estimate the complexity and development cost of such offensive ICS capabilities.<br /> In the second and third parts of the talk we will discuss the process of exploiting ICS devices to achieve code execution and developing ICS implants and OT payloads. We will discuss real-world ICS vulnerabilities and present several implant scenarios such as arbitrary code execution backdoors (as used in TRITON), pin configuration attacks, protocol handler hooking to spoof monitored signal values, suppressing interrupts &amp; alarm functionality, preventing implant removal and control logic restoration and achieving cross-boot persistence. We will discuss several possible OT payload scenarios and how these could be implemented on ICS devices such as the Triconex safety controllers.<br /> In the final part of the talk we&apos;ll wrap up our assessment of the complexity &amp; cost of developing offensive ICS capabilities such as the TRITON attack and offer recommendations to defenders and ICS vendors.\"},\"tineola-taking-a-bite-out-of-enterprise-blockchain\":{\"speakers\":[\"riedesel-stark\",\"hakimian-parsia\"],\"title\":\"Tineola: Taking a Bite Out of Enterprise Blockchain\",\"fullDate\":\"Sat 11 Aug 2018 12:00:00 PM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.11\",\"day\":\"Saturday\",\"start\":\"12:00\",\"duration\":45,\"location\":\"Track 1\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\",\"Tool\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Saturday at 12:00 in Track 1 45 minutes | Demo, Tool\",\"abstract\":\"Blockchain adaptation has reached a fever pitch, andthe community is late to the game of securing these platforms against attack.

Our primary focus was exposing pre-positioned threats on Android devices sold by United States (US) carriers, although our results affect devices worldwide. We will provide details of vulnerabilities in devices from all four major US carriers, as well two smaller US carriers, among others. The vulnerabilities we discovered on devices offered by the major US carriers are the following: arbitrary command execution as the system user, obtaining the modem logs and logcat logs, wiping all user data from a device (i.e., factory reset), obtaining and modifying a user&#x2019;s text messages, sending arbitrary text messages, and getting the phone numbers of the user&#x2019;s contacts, and more.

You receive emails and send messages, right on your wrist. How convenient, this mighty power! But great power always comes with great responsibility. Smartwatches hold precious information just like smartphones, so do they actually fulfill their responsibilities?<br /> In this talk, we will investigate if the Samsung Gear smartwatch series properly screens unauthorized access to user information. More specifically, we will focus on a communication channel between applications and system services, and how each internal Tizen OS components play the parts in access control.<br /> Based on the analysis, we have developed a new simple tool to discover privilege violations in Tizen-based products. We will present an analysis on the Gear smartwatch which turns out to include a number of vulnerabilities in system services.<br /> We will disclose several previously unknown exploits in this presentation. They enable an unprivileged application to take over the wireless services, the user&#x2019;s email account, and more. Further discussions will center on the distribution of those exploits through a registered application in the market, and the causes of the vulnerabilities in detail.\"},\"youre-just-complaining-because-youre-guilty-a-def-con-guide-to-adversarial-testing-of-software-used-in-the-criminal-justice-system\":{\"speakers\":[\"matthews-dr-jeanna-n\",\"adams-nathan\",\"greco-jerome\"],\"title\":\"You&apos;re just complaining because you&apos;re guilty: A DEF CON Guide to Adversarial Testing of Software Used In the Criminal Justice System\",\"fullDate\":\"Sat 11 Aug 2018 10:00:00 AM PDT\",\"date\":\"2018.08.11\",\"day\":\"Saturday\",\"start\":\"10:00\",\"duration\":45,\"location\":\"Track 2\",\"tags\":[\"Demo\"],\"rawDetails\":\"Saturday at 10:00 in Track 2 45 minutes | Demo\",\"abstract\":\"Software is increasingly used to make huge decisions about people&apos;s lives and often these decisions are made with little transparency or accountability to individuals. If there is any place where transparency, third-party review, adversarial testing and true accountability is essential, it is the criminal justice system. Nevertheless, proprietary software is used throughout the system, and the trade secrets of software vendors are regularly deemed more important than the rights of the accused to understand and challenge decisions made by these complex systems. In this talk, we will lay out the map of software in this space from DNA testing to facial recognition to estimating the likelihood that someone will commit a future crime. We will detail the substantial hurdles that prevent oversight and stunning examples of real problems found when hard won third-party review is finally achieved. Finally, we will outline what you as a concerned citizen/hacker can do. Nathan Adams will demo his findings from reviewing NYC&apos;s FST source code, which was finally made public by a federal judge after years of the city&apos;s lab fighting disclosure or even review. Jerome Greco will provide his insight into the wider world of software used in the criminal justice system&#x2014;from technology that law enforcement admits to using but expects the public to trust without question to technology that law enforcement denies when the evidence says otherwise. Jeanna Matthews will talk about the wider space of algorithmic accountability and transparency and why even open source software is not enough.\"}}}"
